# mobile only 2: Electric Booglaloo
I went through hell for this again. this time we have js in it! this is another website made only on a phone. it use rust with rocket 5 and Tera templates.

I kinda cheated for the js debugging since no browser has a debugger that works without connecting it to a laptop. other then that I used only my phone.the end result is a half decent website.with a bit of custom js and css.
